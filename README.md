# PopGridCompare

**Note:** This code needs to be updated and cleaned. July 2021 - CPT. 

Goal of this project is to compare popgrid date products with the same spatial resolution, projections, and CRS, stack them, and identify areas of geographic variance.

We are using the 2015 Nepal Earthquake, Idai, and flood risk in Ecuador as case studies.
